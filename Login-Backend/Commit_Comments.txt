Commit #1 : 
1) Created login and signup routes.
2) Used bcrypt to hash password in signup route so that hashed password is stored in databse instead of password.
3) Used JSON Web Tokens in login route so that token is assigned to user while login.
4) Created middlewares/check-auth.js which can be used to verify if user has access to particular route or not.
